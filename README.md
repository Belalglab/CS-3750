# CS 3710 Projects ( Here is a full description for all of the projects that I have done)
# Banking App
   
This project is a full banking application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes both a frontend and backend, allowing users to manage accounts, perform transactions, and handle authentication securely. The app is designed to simulate real world banking, making it a great foundation for more complex financial applications.

** Frontend: Built with React, offering an intuitive interface for managing accounts and transactions.
Backend: Powered by Express and Node.js, handling everything from user authentication to transaction processing.
npmstuff: Contains npm-related files and dependencies needed for the project.

FourRow Game
   
This is a web based version of the classic "Connect Four" game, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game lets two players take turns dropping discs into a grid, trying to connect four in a row. It’s a fun, interactive way to bring this timeless game to the web.

index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the game’s interface.
styles.css: Custom CSS to style the game.
index.js: The core logic that handles player moves and win conditions.
App.js: Manages the overall game state and flow.

# Hangman Game
   
This project is a full-stack version of the classic Hangman game, complete with both frontend and backend components. Players can guess letters to figure out a randomly selected word. The backend manages the word selection and game logic, while the frontend provides an interactive experience.

Backend: Handles word selection and the logic behind the game.
README.md: Offers a quick overview and instructions for running the game.

 # Hello World
   
This is a simple "Hello World" application that demonstrates how to connect a frontend with a backend. It’s a basic project designed to help you understand the essentials of full-stack development.

Frontend: Displays "Hello World" by fetching data from the backend.
Backend: A basic server that responds with "Hello World" when requested.
README.md: Includes setup instructions and a brief explanation of how the project works.

# MERN Bank App
This is another banking app built with the MERN stack. It shares some similarities with the first banking app but might include different features or improvements. It also has separate frontend and backend components, allowing users to manage their accounts and transactions easily.

Frontend: Developed with React, providing a user-friendly interface for banking tasks.
Backend: Utilizes Node.js and Express to handle server-side functions, including user management and transaction processing.
